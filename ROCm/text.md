To integrate the code from C to ROCm, you'll need to follow these steps:

Include the ROCm header file: Include the hip/hip_runtime.h header file to access the ROCm API.

Identify parallelizable code: Identify the parts of your C code that can be parallelized and executed on the GPU. These are typically loops that perform independent computations on each element of an array or data structure.

Create device functions: Convert the parallelizable code into device functions using the __device__ keyword. These functions will run on the GPU.

Launch kernels: Launch GPU kernels using the __global__ keyword and specify the execution configuration (grid and block dimensions) to distribute the workload across GPU threads.

Memory management: Allocate and manage memory on the GPU using HIP memory management functions like hipMalloc, hipMemcpy, and hipFree.

Synchronization: Use synchronization primitives like __syncthreads() to ensure proper ordering of memory accesses and execution within a thread block.

Error handling: Check for errors using HIP error checking functions like hipGetLastError and hipPeekAtLastError.





To transform the provided code to use ROCm, we need to replace the MLX42 library with the ROCm library. ROCm is a platform for GPU-accelerated computing that includes libraries for both CUDA and HIP (the ROCm equivalent of CUDA).

The first step is to replace the MLX42 library with the ROCm library. This involves replacing the MLX42 functions with their HIP equivalents.

For instance, the mlx_init function is replaced by hipMalloc, mlx_new_image is replaced by hipMalloc, and mlx_put_pixel is replaced by hipMemcpy.

The mlx_loop_hook, mlx_scroll_hook, and mlx_cursor_hook functions are replaced by hipStreamCreate, hipStreamSynchronize, and hipStreamDestroy respectively.

The mlx_loop function is replaced by hipStreamSynchronize.

The mlx_delete_image and mlx_terminate functions are replaced by hipFree and hipDeviceReset respectively.

Here is how you would transform the fractal_init function:
